## Development Notes (Personal Note from Original Author)

This extension was created due to my personal need of reading materials across multiple devices. I'm far from being a web developer. TabTogether was created with extensive help from Copilot and Gemini.

I had planned to expand it to synchronize automatically tabs' states and groups, so that I can start reading an Arxiv pdf on one device and seamlessly continue on another. Due to Firefox Sync issues (potential latency, reliability concerns), I don't see any point in continuing development further myself. It feels like this functionality would work best if integrated directly into Firefox itself.

Despite these challenges, the source code is open at https://github.com/ophilar/TabTogether under the MIT license. If you have ideas on how to overcome the Sync limitations or wish to build upon the existing code, your contributions are encouraged.

Thank you!
